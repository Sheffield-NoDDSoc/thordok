# Thordok

NoDDSoc's Discord bot for automating the boring things.

## Design Choices

A few notes from the Webmaster that made this bot, [Jack Gledhill](https://github.com/Jack-Gledhill).

- [Python](https://python.org): I chose Python because I suspected it would be the easiest for a future Webmaster to pick up. 
- [Pycord](https://pycord.dev): Pycord is a fork of Discord.py, that addresses some of the shortcomings and promises to keep on top of Discord's API changes.
